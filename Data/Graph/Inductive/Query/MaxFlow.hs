-- | Maximum Flow algorithm
--
-- We are given a flow network @G=(V,E)@ with source @s@ and sink @t@
-- where each edge @(u,v)@ in @E@ has a nonnegative capacity
-- @c(u,v)>=0@, and we wish to find a flow of maximum value from @s@
-- to @t@.
--
-- A flow in @G=(V,E)@ is a real-valued function @f:VxV->R@ that
-- satisfies:
--
-- @
-- For all u,v in V, f(u,v)\<=c(u,v)
-- For all u,v in V, f(u,v)=-f(v,u)
-- For all u in V-{s,t}, Sum{f(u,v):v in V } = 0
-- @
--
-- The value of a flow f is defined as @|f|=Sum {f(s,v)|v in V}@, i.e.,
-- the total net flow out of the source.
--
-- In this module we implement the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is
-- the Ford-Fulkerson method but using the shortest path from @s@ to
-- @t@ as the augmenting path along which the flow is incremented.

-- Some test cases: clr595 is from the CLR textbook, page 595. The value of
-- the maximum flow for s=1 and t=6 (23) coincides with the example but the
-- flow itself is slightly different since the textbook does not compute the
-- shortest augmenting path from s to t, but just any path. However remember
-- that for a given flow graph the maximum flow is not unique.
